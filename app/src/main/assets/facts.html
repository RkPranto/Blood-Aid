    <p>As you plan  small acts of kindness or ways to volunteer, don&rsquo;t forget the impact of blood  donation. Why donate blood? Joni  Baker, clinical laboratory manager, UnityPoint Health, explains how something  so simple can make such a positive difference in our world.</p>
<h2>1. Less Than 10% of Eligible Donors Do</h2>
<p>Blood  donation is a safe process, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and  the American Association of Blood Banks to make sure the donor, blood supply  and recipient stay protected. </p>
<h3>Rarest  Blood Type</h3>
<p>In the  United States, Baker says group AB is the rarest  blood type, followed by group B. Group A and O are the most common blood  types. Baker breaks down which blood types can give to one another:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Group O red cells can be given to anyone (universal red cell donor is  group O). O donors are sought after because their cells can be transfused to the  most recipients.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Group AB red cells can only be given to someone who is group AB. Group  AB can also receive transfusion of red cells of any type: AB, A, B or O. </li>
    <li>Group O can only receive transfusion of O red cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first  time you donate blood, a screening process is completed, including measuring  your hemoglobin. On future donations, an abbreviated screening process may be  used. Baker outlines the blood donation rules you need to know:</p>
<h3>Blood  Donation Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You must be 18 years old or have parental permission if you&rsquo;re 16 or  17.</li>
    <li>You must weigh 120 pounds or more. </li>
    <li>You need a valid driver&rsquo;s license or a passport for identification.</li>
    <li>You must be free of any major organ disease, including heart disease,  lung disease and bleeding tendencies.</li>
    <li>You must not be taking antibiotics or other supplements that could  influence the donation.</li>
    <li>You must wait 12 months if you had a tattoo applied in a state that  does not regulate tattoo facilities. That includes District of Columbia,  Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York,  Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.</li>
    <li>Recent surgery or travel may mean deferral.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Baker says  the most common reason someone is unable to donate is because of low  hemoglobin. Acceptable  hemoglobin is 13.0 grams/deciliter for males and 12.5 grams/deciliter for  females.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need  iron to make new red cells to maintain your hemoglobin. Eating foods high in iron, such as fortified  cereals and grains, spinach, green lentils, beans, nuts and many other foods  can help,&rdquo; Baker says. </p>
<p>For any  questions you may have on blood donation rules, Baker encourages checking your  local blood center&rsquo;s website or giving them a call.</p>
<h2>2. It Saves Lives</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/how-blood-donations-help.html" target="_blank">Donations are essential</a> for trauma patients and people undergoing a  variety of situations, including  surgeries, transplants, chronic illnesses, blood disorders and cancer. Because over  90% of people who are eligible to donate do not, Baker says there&rsquo;s always a  need for donors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life-saving  blood components can support recovery from injuries or disease,&rdquo; Baker says. &ldquo;A  single blood donation can give one to four patients a better outcome, a chance  at survival.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>3. It&rsquo;s Only an Hour of Your Time</h2>
<p>The entire  donation process takes approximately one hour, with about 10 minutes of that  time being the actual blood donation. The whole blood donation volume is  usually about 500 milliliters, or one pint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat a meal  or snack before you plan donate, and don&rsquo;t donate if you aren&rsquo;t feeling well. After  you finish, you&rsquo;ll get a beverage and snack to replace volume,&rdquo; Baker says.</p>
<h2>4. There&rsquo;s Little Pain Involved</h2>
<p>When the  needle is inserted, you may feel uncomfortable but shouldn&rsquo;t while the blood is  being drawn.</p>
<p> If your arm  feels sore after donating, consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliver  with acetaminophen to alleviate the achiness. There&rsquo;s a chance you may feel  some weakness in the arm where you donated as well, so try to avoid physical  activity or heavy lifting for at least five hours. </p>
<h2>5. It Doesn&rsquo;t Have to be a One-Time Gift</h2>
<p>Donation  can be a single, whole blood donation (red cells, plasma and platelets) or an  apheresis donation, where one component of blood, such as red cells or  platelets, is shared and the other components are returned to the donor. Whole  blood donations can be made every eight weeks, up to six times per year. </p>
<p> Baker says  another type of donation is called double red cell donations, which can be made  every 112 days, up to three times per year. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A double  red cell donation is an apheresis process where the whole blood is removed, and  the red cells separated, while the plasma and platelets are returned to the  donor. A double red cell donation results in two red cells that can benefit two  recipients,&rdquo; Baker says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reward is that  something you can so easily share can really make a significant difference in  someone else&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
