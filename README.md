# Blood-Aid
This make the  communication easier between the blood donor and the blood needy patient.

#### The Database is hosted on a remote server. So, an API was created to access the database from the App. The API is on https://bloodaid.hipranto.com . Documentation is not publicly available now. But hopefully the API will be public very soon sothat more people can make this kind of app very easily. More people can get help from this kind of app by communicating with blood donor which is our main purpose of this project. If we make the API public, that actually aligned with our purpose.
